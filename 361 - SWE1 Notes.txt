361 - Software Engineering 1 notes

Week 1
===========================================================================================

SDLC - requirements -> design -> implementation -> testing -> maintenance

Software engineering is solving real world problems without making things worse or excessive costs by creating software

Software is not enough -> need people and context

System Boundary: software being developed

Great software has quality attributes:
	-> reliability
	-> efficiency
	-> integrity
	-> usability
	-> maintainability
	-> testability
	-> flexibility
	-> portability
	-> reusability
	-> interoperability

	contains the right features for the right data:

		-> use cases - the activities a system supports
			e.g. tweet a vote reort, view delays on map

		-> entities - the kinds of objects that are involved in use cases
			e.g. tweets, user accounts, polling locations, maps

		-> attributes - the props of the netities
			e.g. tweets have: timestamp, text, sender

	* Need to understand what it should do before you can build a great system *
