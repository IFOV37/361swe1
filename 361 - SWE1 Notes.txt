361 - Software Engineering 1 notes

Week 1
===========================================================================================

SDLC - requirements -> design -> implementation -> testing -> maintenance

Software engineering is solving real world problems without making things worse or excessive costs by creating software

Software is not enough -> need people and context

System Boundary: software being developed

Great software has quality attributes:
	-> reliability
		-> consistency
		-> accuracy
		-> error tolerance

	-> efficiency
		-> execution efficiency
		-> storage efficiency

	-> integrity
		-> access control
		-> access audit

	-> usability
		-> operability
		-> training
		-> communicativeness

	-> maintainability
		-> simplicity
		-> conciseness
		-> instrumentation
		-> self-descriptiveness

	-> testability
		-> simplicity
		-> instrumentation
		-> self-descriptiveness
		-> modularity

	-> flexibility
		-> simplicity
		-> expandability
		-> generality
		-> modularity

	-> portability
		-> simplicity
		-> software system independence
		-> machine independence


	-> reusability
		-> simplicity
		-> generality
		-> modularity
		-> software system independence
		-> machine independence

	-> interoperability
		-> modularity
		-> communications commonality
		-> data commonality


	contains the right features for the right data:

		-> use cases - the activities a system supports
			e.g. tweet a vote reort, view delays on map

		-> entities - the kinds of objects that are involved in use cases
			e.g. tweets, user accounts, polling locations, maps

		-> attributes - the props of the netities
			e.g. tweets have: timestamp, text, sender

	* Need to understand what it should do before you can build a great system *

	

	Process: well defined and usually involves a set of tools and techniques
		-> set of ordered tasks

		SDLC:
			requirements
			design
			implementation
			testing
			operation

			Implied planning and risk mgmt

	Life-cycle: the process of building a product

	Requirements:
		-> talk to customers
		-> diagrams
		-> watch users, etc..


	Design:
		Architectural: Figuring out the overall STRUCTURE of the system
			-> what components?
			-> how should these be connected?

		Program: Figuring out how CODE should be organized
			-> how should each component's code be distributed among classes and/or functions


	Implementation:
		-> write code
		-> comments/other doc
		-> helping others/answering questions

	Testing:
		-> unit testing
			-> individual components

		-> system integration testing
			-> components that work well together

		-> usability testing
			-> good user interfaces

		-> acceptance testing
			-> customer/user happy?

	Operation:
		-> code complies, passes all test, looks good on desktop
		-> distrobution
		-> debugging after users
		-> post mortem


	-> iterative improvements
		-> whole system working pretty well then add features

	-> incremental improvements
		-> part of system working really well then add more parts

Waterfall:
	requirements analysis
	design
	implementation
	testing
	op/maint

	drawbacks:
		-> non-iterative: hard to handle changes

	-> moved more to a spiral kind of model now to address issues

	emphasis:
		-> simplicity
		-> traceability

	weakness:
		-> req/design mistakces costly

	style: 
		-> highly controlled
		-> high ceremony

	Good choice for small systems
		-> fully understand reqs


Spiral:

	emphasis:
		-> risk mgmt
		-> exploring alternatives

	weakness:
		-> exploring alternatives can be costly

	style: 
		-> moderately controlled
		-> moderate ceremony

	Good choice for larger systems with vague reqs
		-> many alternatives for designing and coding


Agile:
	-> customer provies info
	-> "spike" eval and control risk
	-> prioritize stories and plan
	-> write/run/mod unit tests
	-> implement
	-> sys and acceptance tests
	-> operation
	-> start again


	Methods/Examples:
		Extreme Programming (XP): focus on simplicity and rapid iteration

		Scrum: 30-day iterations
			-> multiple self-organizing teams
			-> daily "scrum" coordination

		Crystal: collection of approaches based on the notion that every project needs
				a unique set of policies and conventions


	emphasis:
		-> flexibility
		-> immediacy

	weakness:
		-> continual rework can be costly

	style: 
		-> rapid and organic
		-> low ceremony

	Good for rapidly create something very small, but useful, then expand



Week 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 2.1: Project  (only 1 video this week)
-----------------------------------------------


Project will use methods:

	Waterfall model to dev reqs and preliminary design

	last 2 weeks will transition to spiral model to code part of the design


Need to know:
	-> Know the waterfall process
	-> Understand the assignment
	-> Divide the work among your teamates
	-> Make sure everyone is doing their part
	-> Check one another's work

Divide responsibilities





Week 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 3.1: Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

Requiremenet analysis
	-> get customers to write down what they want
	-> talk and make diagrams
	-> watch users to see what they need
	-> gather and discuss


Good requirements:
	-> correct
	-> consistent
	-> unambiguous
	-> complete
	-> relevant
	-> testable
	-> traceable


Typical parts of reqs docs:

	Functional reqs:
		-> unstructured text
			written from:
				-> external viewpoint (reqs def)
					definition: stated from vpt of somebody outside the system
						-> the system is a black box with some interface
						-> emphasis on the role of the system

				-> system viewpoint (reqs specification)
					specification: stated vpt from somebody inside the system
						-> environment is accessed via inputs & outputs
						-> emphasis on how the system works

		-> use cases
			-> describes activity supported by the system
				-> each use case describes a way to use the system
			-> each use case is like a "bundle of scenarios" that are all
				the same except for very minor details
			-> a little more formal and precise than unstructure text

Use case: (basic)

	name: succint and meaningful

	actor: who does the act

	preconditions: true b4 act?

	post cond: true after act?

	flow of events: steps




	Non-Functional (quality) reqs:  How well the system should do stuff
		-> unstructured text
			-> fit criteria
				-> exactly how good does the system need to be?
				-> driven by customer needs


				quality attribute examples:
					-> system must ask for tweet clarification w/in 5 mins
						-> user probably still online

					-> drawbridge must rise w/in 1min
						-> so traffic only stops 5 mins (1+1 + 3ship)

					-> at least 95% of the code must be Java
						-> porting apps to linux has proven to cost only $xxxx in the past

	Diagrams
		-> Class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams
		-> dataflow, sequence, and state diagrams

		use case diagram: shows supported activites

		UML class and entity-relationship diagrams: show entites, attributes, and relationships

		dataflow diagram: shows flo of information

		message sequence diagram: shows flow of control

		state chart: shows change over time



Lecture 3.2: Notations
-----------------------------------------------


	Diagrams
		-> Class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams
		-> dataflow, sequence, and state diagrams

		use case diagram: shows supported activites

		UML class and entity-relationship diagrams: show entites, attributes, and relationships

		UML class diag:
			User has twitter username
			repression tweet has user, when (datetime), and text (string)
			repression report has source (tweet) location (geocode) when (datetime), and details (string)
			etc...  Also has 1 to *, 1 to 1, * to *, etc.. 
				-> can show system boundaries via "container"

			-> 1 box / kind of entity, listing attributes

			-> lines w/out arrowheads show references, lbl'd w/ cardinality

			-> lines w/ hollow arrowheads for specilization

			-> lines w/ reg ah's use to indicate dependencies

		ERD:
			-> similar to UML, but:
				-> branches for entites
				-> diamond for relationships
				-> num or vars on lines show cardinality
				-> one box per kind of entity


		dataflow diagram: shows flow of information

			-> like a flowchart but not necessarily in a top down order
			-> lacks some info where things go

			-> helps to do a separate data flow for each use case

			-> oval is a "function" provided by system
				-> each inward arrow is a parm
				-> outward arrow is output


			-> each rectangle is an actor
				-> person, place, or thing that can do stuff to ini events

			-> half rectangle = data store (file or db)


		message sequence diagram: shows flow of control
			-> kind of likc job scheduling or a burndown chart

			-> dashed arrow for info back

		state chart: shows change over time
			-> general and a very basic idea of the status



Lecture 3.3: Example Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

Nothing




Lecture 3.4: Evaluate/ion Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

Validation: build the right system
	-> reqs def accurately reflect the customers needs?

Verification: build the system tright
	-> confirm that 1 doc or artifact conforms to another
		-> does code match design?
		-> design match spec?
		-> spec match def?



	How do we eval reqs?
		-> paper prototyping
		-> formal analysis
		etc..



	Prototyping:
		-> you depict what you think the system should look like
		-> you test the prototypes
		-> fix up the prototypes

		kinds/types:
			fidelity = fi = closeness to what the ultimate product would look like

			throwaway
				-> paper, lo-fi (photoshopped)
							-> photoshop, ppt, html

			evolutionary
				-> hi-fi (implemented on target platform)
					-> not fully functional, but incop'd into final product
					-> 


			stakeholder review
				-> sit down with s/hs
				-> eng present understanding
				-> stake correct undstng
				-> discuss
				-> revision

			Manual analysis
				->systematically check consistency

			formal analysis
				-> the one we are doing for hwk 1
					(req def, req spec)
				-> very expensive
				




Week 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 4.1: Architecture
-----------------------------------------------

	-> shows pieces of a system and their relationships


component: self-containted piece of a system, w/ clearly defined interfaces

connector = a linkage b/w components via an interface


Architectural Style
	-> cerain archs occur over and over
		-> certain kinds of comps and conns
		-> certain typical arrangements



	user <-> website <-> db1
				|
				db2

		-> could be just about any web app

Common design:

Client-Server:
	
	Server = component that provices services
	Client = comp that interacts with user and calls server

	Typical setup:  user <-> client <-> server

Peer to peer:

	peer = comp provices svrs and may signal other peers

Publish-Subscribe:

	publish = comp advertses that it can sent certain events

	subscribe = a comp registers to rec certain events



pipe and filter:
	filter = comp that transforms data

	pipe = con that passes data b/w filters


Layering = comp provices svrcs to the next layer
	-> comps "hide" lower layers





Lecture 4.2: Architecture Decomposition
-----------------------------------------------

Decomposition: providing a detailed view of a component


Approaches for decomposing an arch:
	-> functional
			break req into fns, then break recursively into sub fns
				-> one comp per fn

			each fn computationally combines the output of sub fns

	-> data-oriented
			identify data structs in reqs break down recursively
				-> one comp per d/s

			each data s contains part of the data

	-> object-oriented
			identify d/s aligned w/ fns in reqs, recursive breakdown
				-> one class comp per data + fn package

			each comp contains part of the data+fns

	-> process-oriented
			break reqs into steps, then into sub steps recursively
				-> 1 cmp per sub step

			each sub step completes one part of a task

	-> feature-oriented
			break reqs into services, then svrcs into features
				-> 1 cmp per service or feature

			each feature makes the service "a little better"

	-> event-oriented
			break reqs into systems of events, then into sub events and state changes
				-> each comp receives and sends certain events,
				and manages certain state changes

			each component is like a stateful agent




Lecture 4.2: Architecture Evaluation
-----------------------------------------------

4 basic ways to eval arch designs

	1) compare against desired quality attributes
		maintainability
			-> how hard will it be to make anticipated changes?

		efficiency
			-> can system respond quickly?

		reliability
			-> will it perform properly under assumed conditions?

		integrity
			-> possible to put system in bad state?

		usability
			-> can real users complete their gaosl with the system?

		testability
			-> can you (semi-)auto test if the system is right?

		flexibility
			-> how easily can the system adapt to unusual conditions?

		portability
			-> could you get the system to run on a new platform?

		reusability
			-> what parts of the system could you use in a new system?

		interoperability
			-> can the sysm talk to other relevant systems?

			
	2) check for problematic failure modes

	3) Walk through use cases

	4) Verify conformatnce to checklist of principles





Week 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 5.1: Object-Oriented Design
-----------------------------------------------

Objects have a concern in the sense that they have a purpose

Each class should have a clearly focused purpose
	-> each member usually corresponsd to 1 attribute
	-> only related items w/in class

	i) same for packages


copuling: when one module is involved in anothers modules concern
	-> reduces maintainability

cohesion: when a module is devoted to its concern
	-> increases maintainability
		i) functional (best)
			->work together for 1 purpose
		ii) communication
			-> use same data
		iii) procedural
			-> A, then B, vaguely related purpose
		iv) temporal
			-> A, then B, not related purpose
		v) logical
			-> either A or B might be executed
		vi) coincidental (worst)

tip: split modules to reduce cycles

tip: in reuse, prefer composition over inheritance
	-> in general, use comp to add features or to reuse code
	-> inheritance to add a new version of an entity

Interface is a promise
	-> publicly available information of the class

incremental dev: much of systems value resides in one subsection

iterative dev: value spread out over much of the system







Use UML diagrams
	-> one box per kind of entity
	-> lines w/o arrowheads show refs
	-> lines w/ open ah's for specialization
	-> lines w/ reg ah's indicate dependencies



Lecture 5.2: Design Patterns
-----------------------------------------------
	-> strategies for your "toolkit of ideas"
	-> templates for solutions
	-> codified best practices
	-> recognizable based on structure and purpose


Builder: knows how to create a complex obj
	-> insatntiating requires filling it with parts or lengthy config

Adapter: translates one interface to another by wrapping
	-> overcomes incompatibility

Facade: object that provices a unified, high lvl interface to a subsystem
	-> used when calling a subsys reqs a frequent series of copmlex lines of code

Memento: encapsulate state in an obj
	-> if you might want to rtn a certain state later	

Interpreter: parses and acts on instructions written in a certain syntax
	-> add scriptability

Observer: watching for another object to change state
	-> maintains a list of observers and notifies them
	-> used in event driven design





Lecture 5.3: Design Patterns 2
-----------------------------------------------

Template method: breaks an algorithm into steps
	-> children inherit and override any step they need to change
	-> useful if a gen algo can be mod'd slightly and reused

Factory method: define an interface for creating an obj
	-> let the classes that implement the interface decide which class to instantiate
	-> lets a class defer instantiation to sub classes

Strategy: allows for the selection of algo at runtime

Decorator: useful for assigning behavior at runtime indply of other instances of the same class
	-> allows multiple decorations per class

Composite: allows for reduction of complexity by dealing with a group of objs as a single obj

Visitor: allows for separation of the algo and the data it works on
	-> built on method overloading and dynamic types





hwk 4 contribs:

Contributed the selections for interfaces we want to show.  Provided the information that our design is incremental until the underlying structure is complete, then we switch to iterative development.

Week 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 6.1: Agile Overview
-----------------------------------------------

Several processes
	-> Dyanmic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
	-> Scrum
	-> Crystal
	-> eXtreme Programming (XP)

Agile = flexibility and immediacy
	-> rapid and organic
	-> good choice for systems where rapidly create something small, but useful, then expand from there


Agile Manifesto
	-> individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	-> working software over comprehensive docs
	-> customer collab over contract negotiation
	-> responding to change over following a plan

Process:
	1) 	customer provides short reqs
	2) 	eval and ctrl risk
	3) 	prioritize reqs and plan
	4) 	write/run mod unit tests
	5) 	implement (with possible rtn to stp 4)
	6) 	system and acceptance tests
	7) 	operation

Iterations:
	purpose: few small issues rather than a large OMG at end
	timing: sprint 1 month
			xp 1-2 wks

	grouping: not ever iter results into releases
	sub-dividing: each iter has micro iters where team tries to complete some stories


Principles of XP:
	-> comm b/w customer and devs
	-> simplicity and grow when required
	-> feedback from users early and often
	-> courage to speak truth w/ respect


	XP practices : role of the customer
		-> whole team, customer part of team
		-> cusotmer tests, participates in testing
		-> sustainable pace, no all nighters or superheroes
		-> small releases
		-> simple design
		-> refactor as needed
		-> continuous integration, reg chk to see if sys on track

	: roll of teamwork
		-> pair programming, aka co pilot and swap
		-> test driven dev (tests 1st)
		-> collective code ownership, one ego for the whole team
		-> coding standards, pick a format and use it

XP can degrade into a hacker's paradise
Knowledge lives in heads, not on paper
No specialization




Lecture 6.2: Customer Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------

Customer is part of the team - even directing the team

	User stories fits on 3x5 note card, to keep in small and simple (minimalist)
		-> not written in stone, revision expected
		-> further comm usually needed

	Collect user story
	Identify tasks
		-> often helps to sketch arch

	Estimate effort
		-> give honest estimate and sustainable pace

		Spikes
			purpose = discover answer to difficult problems (either design or implementation)
				-> small pgm to explore and test possible solutions

	Prioritize stores: (done by customer - making business decisions)
		-> engineers get to make tech decisions

	Plan work
		-> chosen stories, teammates get organized, figure out pairs (if using)

	Communicate Progres
		-> track effort
		-> communicate early
		-> release dates don't slip, functionality slips




Lecture 6.3: Individual Interactions
-----------------------------------------------

Acceptance Tests and User Stories
	-> each story may have multiple acceptance tests
	-> a single test validates an aspect of the story
	-> tell what the customer will use to judge success
	-> you know when you can stop developing (since the test was passed)

	Creating the tests:
		-> ideally, customer writes
		-> blackbox tests
		-> unambiguous
	-> run at least once a week
	-> useful to have integration machine where you can run tests

	-> exhaustive testing usually infeasible
		-> so use representative testing
			-> typical inputs
			-> boundary cases

Pair programming:
	Driver:
		-> ctrls keyboard and mouse
		-> actively talking with copilot
		-> explains intent of code

	copilot:
		-> pays attention, watches for mistakes
		-> offers ideas
		-> discus course of action
		-> requests to switch when necessary


	-> if someone asks, you must say yes, if you can
	-> pick a std format
	-> choose large enough font to be seen
	-> take turns with other ppl

Agile Modeling:
	model iteratively and incrementally
	don't let them distract you from the "hunt"
	model w/ other ppl
	create simple content
	use simple tools




Week 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lecture 7.1: Effort Overview
-----------------------------------------------

Planning big projects:
	1) figuure what it entails
		-> reqs, arch, design
	2) dependencies & priorities
		-> what has to be done in what order?
	3) how much effort?
	4) plan, refine, plan, refine...

activity graph shows dependencies
	-> start and end circle filled in  (am I really writing this garbage?)
	-> 1 circle/milestone
	-> lbl'd arrows = activities

Effort: records of similar tasks
	-> Personal software process (psp)
		-> record size of component (lines of code)
			-> break down by # added, reused, etc..
		-> record time taken
			-> breakdown planning, design, implement, etc..
		-> refer to data for future predictions

	est models
		algorithmic (cocomo)
			-> inputs = desc of prj + team
			=> outputs = est of eff req'd

		machine learning (cbr)
			-> gather descs of old prjs + time taken
			-> run a pgm to create model


Lecture 7.2: Schedule
-----------------------------------------------

Critical path: longets route through the activity graph
	-> sort all milestones in "topological order"
		-> i.e. in terms of dependencies.

	-> for each milestone, compute the earliest that the milestone can be reached from its immediate depenecies


Slack time

	activity slack = latest possible start time - earliest possible start time
		-> how "spare time" that activity has (in case something goes wrong)
		-> activities on critical path have ZERO slack time


Gantt chart
	shows acts on calender
		-> useful for visualizing ordering of tasks and slack
		-> for deciding how many ppl to hire

	one bar/activity



Lecture 7.3: Testing
-----------------------------------------------

Why test?
	-> saves lives and money

	Coverage : measures or metrics
		-> abstraction of "what a test suite tests" in a structural sense

		common measures:
			statement cov : line/basic block - which statements exe in test suite
			decision cov : whih bool exprs in ctrl structures evalt to T and F during exe
			path cov : which paths through pgm ctrl flow are taken
			mutation cov : ability to detect random vars to the code

	black box testing
		-> treat system as black box
			-> don't look at source code


	white box testing
		-> opens box
			-> also glass box or structural testing
		-> use src code (or other structure beyond i/o spec) to design test cases

		
stages:
	1)	unit testing - by devs of modules
		-> earliest type done
		-> small as single fn or method
		-> tools to support available for most popular languages

	2) 	integration testing - combines unit tested mods and tests how they interact
		-> combines unit tested modules to test interaction
		-> focus on interfaces b/w components and assemblies of multiple comps
		-> often more formal

	3) 	system testing (whole program)
		-> focuses on breaking the system
		-> defects in completed product, not just in how components interact
		-> checks quality of reqs as well as the system
		-> often includes stress testing, goes beyond bounds of well-defined behavior

	4) 	acceptance testing
		-> black box
		-> done by end users

	5) bonus: all times : regression testing
		-> changes can break code or reintroduce old bugs
		-> usually a set of cases that have failed (and then succeded) in the past
		-> finding small regressions is an ongoing research area


Test Driven development
	-> 1 way to make sure code is tested as early as possible:
		write test cases b4 code
			-> often used in XP (agile)

	How do we add a feature to pgm?
		-> add test case that fails, but would succeed w/ new feature implemented
		-> run all tests, make sure only the new test fails
		-> write code to implement the new feature
		-> rerun all tests, amking sure the new test succeeds (and no others break)

		



Lecture 7.4: Refactoring
